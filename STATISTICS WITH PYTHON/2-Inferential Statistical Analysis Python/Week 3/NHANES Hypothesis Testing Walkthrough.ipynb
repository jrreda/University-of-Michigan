    "### Hypothesis Tests for One Proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic hypothesis test may be the one-sample test for a proportion.  This test is used if we have specified a particular value as the null value for the proportion, and we wish to assess if the data are compatible with the true parameter value being equal to this specified value.  One-sample tests are not used very often in practice, because it is not very common that we have a specific fixed value to use for comparison. For illustration, imagine that the rate of lifetime smoking in another country was known to be 40%, and we wished to assess whether the rate of lifetime smoking in the US were different from 40%.  In the following notebook cell, we carry out the (two-sided) one-sample test that the population proportion of smokers is 0.4, and obtain a p-value of 0.43.  This indicates that the NHANES data are compatible with the proportion of (ever) smokers in the US being 40%. "

    "The following cell carries out the same test as performed above using the Statsmodels library.  The results in the first (default) case below are slightly different from the results obtained above because Statsmodels by default uses the sample proportion instead of the null proportion when computing the standard error.  This distinction is rarely consequential, but we can specify that the null proportion should be used to calculate the standard error, and the results agree exactly with what we calculated above.  The first two lines below carry out tests using the normal approximation to the sampling distribution of the test statistic, and the third line below carries uses the exact binomial sampling distribution.  We can see here that the p-values are nearly identical in all three cases. This is expected when the sample size is large, and the proportion is not close to either 0 or 1."

    "Comparative tests tend to be used much more frequently than tests comparing one population to a fixed value.  A two-sample test of proportions is used to assess whether the proportion of individuals with some trait differs between two sub-populations.  For example, we can compare the smoking rates between females and males. Since smoking rates vary strongly with age, we do this in the subpopulation of people between 20 and 25 years of age.  In the cell below, we carry out this test without using any libraries, implementing all the test procedures covered elsewhere in the course using Python code.  We find that the smoking rate for men is around 10 percentage points greater than the smoking rate for females, and this difference is statistically significant (the p-value is around 0.01)."

Just as with proportions, for comparing means there are one and two-sample tests, z-tests and t-tests, and one-sided and two-sided tests.  As with tests of proportions, one-sample tests of means are not very common, but we illustrate a one sample test in the cell below.  We compare systolic blood pressure to the fixed value 120 (which is the lower threshold for \"pre-hypertension\"), and find that the mean is significantly different from 120 (the point estimate of the mean is 126)."
