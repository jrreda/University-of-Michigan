One Population Proportion

Sample can be considered a simple random sample
Large enough sample size ()
Confidence Interval: At least 10 of each outcome ()
Hypothesis Test: At least 10 of each outcome ()
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Two Population Proportions

Samples can be considered two simple random samples
Samples can be considered independent of one another
Large enough sample sizes ()
Confidence Interval: At least 10 of each outcome ()
Hypothesis Test: At least 10 of each outcome () - Where (the common population proportion estimate)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

One Population Mean

Sample can be considered a simple random sample
Sample comes from a normally distributed population
This assumption is less critical with a large enough sample size (application of the C.L.T.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

One Population Mean Difference

Sample of differences can be considered a simple random sample
Sample of differences comes from a normally distributed population of differences
This assumption is less critical with a large enough sample size (application of the C.L.T.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Two Population Means

Samples can be considered a simple random samples
Samples can be considered independent of one another
Samples each come from normally distributed populations
This assumption is less critical with a large enough sample size (application of the C.L.T.)
Populations have equal variances – pooled procedure used
If this assumption cannot be made, unpooled procedure used
